# Scoring-Game
Simple time waster game.
This game is something like endless runner.
With score, teleports and random generated(infinity) path for player.
The idea of game is simple. 
Player move forward till need turn left or right, with time movement speed increase. 
If player goes out of path it's Game Over.
Game based on best score. Score can get by pickup balls(+3 to Score) and by turning left/right (+1 to Score).
In this game teleport can teleport player to random position on path.
There is two type of teleports, one of them decrease player movement speed, other increase.
